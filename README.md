# My contribution to Sol Tenebrae (Tedious Cats, COMP230)

Throughout the development process of Sol Tenebrae I have been helping to implement the assets developed by the artists and our writer
into the game. My primary focus for our game was on the artificial intelligence which I prioritised throughout all three sprints. 
The goal of the AI was to follow the player, attack  the player, take damage and subsequently die.

One of the first things I added to the game was  the basic AI health and death system seen here. ![alt text](https://github.com/JamesPropPitt/comp230-pre-production/blob/master/healthai.png "Health AI")
