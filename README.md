# My contribution to Sol Tenebrae (Tedious Cats, COMP230)

Throughout the development process of Sol Tenebrae I have been helping to implement the assets developed by the artists and our writer
into the game. My primary focus for our game was on the artificial intelligence which I prioritised throughout all three sprints. 
The goal of the AI was to follow the player, attack  the player, take damage and subsequently die.

One of the first things I added to the game was  the basic AI health and death system seen here. ![](https://github.com/JamesPropPitt/comp230-pre-production/blob/master/healthai.png "Health AI")






Lastly, something which I was unable to show off in the video as it has been taken out of the latest build is my ragdoll 
function, which causes the corpse of an enemy to ragdoll upon death for a brief two seconds before despawning. ![](https://github.com/JamesPropPitt/comp230-pre-production/blob/master/ragdollbp.png)
